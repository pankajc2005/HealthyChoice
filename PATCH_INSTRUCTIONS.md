# Fix for "Namespace not specified" Error in Flutter Project

This error occurs because the Flutter plugin `flutter_keyboard_visibility` does not have a namespace defined in its Android build.gradle file, which is required for newer Android Gradle Plugin versions.

## Option 1: Manual Patch (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the plugin directory:
   ```
   C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\hosted\pub.dev\flutter_keyboard_visibility-5.4.1\android
   ```

2. Open the `build.gradle` file in this directory

3. Replace the entire content with the following:

   ```gradle
   group 'com.jrai.flutter_keyboard_visibility'
   version '1.0'
   
   buildscript {
       repositories {
           google()
           mavenCentral()
       }
   
       dependencies {
           classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.0'
       }
   }
   
   rootProject.allprojects {
       repositories {
           google()
           mavenCentral()
       }
   }
   
   apply plugin: 'com.android.library'
   
   android {
       namespace 'com.jrai.flutter_keyboard_visibility'
       compileSdkVersion 31
   
       defaultConfig {
           minSdkVersion 16
       }
       lintOptions {
           disable 'InvalidPackage'
       }
   }
   ```

4. Save the file and run:
   ```
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. Now try building your app again

## Option 2: Use a Different Version of the Plugin

If the above solution doesn't work, you can try downgrading the flutter_keyboard_visibility plugin or waiting for an updated version that includes the namespace declaration.

To downgrade, update your pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_keyboard_visibility: ^5.3.0  # Try an older version
```

Then run:
```
flutter pub get
```

## Option 3: Add namespace to your app's build.gradle

If you still encounter issues, ensure your app's build.gradle file has a namespace:

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` 
2. Check if it has a namespace declaration like:
   ```gradle
   android {
     namespace = "com.example.HealthyChoice"
     ...
   }
   ```

3. If it doesn't have this line, add it inside the android block.
